One draw back would be that you have to type in your answers which allows for more human error if you miss-spell or if the formatting isnâ€™t 100% accurate.

It would be better to have drop down boxes with options to ensure it pulls data for the user. It would also be nice it you could pull the time of each sighting to identify an patterns based on time of day.
